  <h1>Hi, I'm Lukasz Przeklasa</h1>
  <p>Mechanical Engineering graduate with a passion for hands-on problem-solving and deep experience in automotive systems, fabrication, and diagnostics.</p>

<section>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My engineering journey began long before college — fueled by a lifelong obsession with cars and a drive to learn by doing. My mom still recalls how the first toy I ever picked up was a little car, and that early fascination only grew. From collecting Hot Wheels and playing racing games to naming every car on the street, I was drawn to everything automotive.</p>

  <p>That passion became practical when I got my first car — a 1995 BMW 325i — which I’ve owned for over seven years and driven more than 60,000 miles. I’ve rebuilt and maintained nearly every system on that car, from the driveline, clutch, cooling system, and suspension, to brake and engine upgrades. I did it all myself, learning as I went. That hands-on experience didn’t just make me a capable technician — it inspired me to pursue a career in engineering, blending practical skill with design and analysis.</p>

  <p>Since then, I’ve worked on a range of personal and family vehicles, including off-road and luxury platforms like the Lexus GX470 and BMW 740iL. These projects have honed my ability to troubleshoot complex systems, fabricate custom solutions, and manage full vehicle repairs with precision and confidence.</p>

  <p>Today, I bring that same dedication, curiosity, and drive to every engineering challenge I take on. I'm always seeking opportunities where I can apply my hands-on background and technical knowledge to design better systems, solve real-world problems, and contribute to innovative mechanical solutions.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <article>
    <h3>BMW 325i (E36) – Daily Driver and Ongoing Personal Project (2018–Present)</h3>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> My first car and my most important teacher — I bought this 1995 BMW 325i seven years ago with no mechanical experience. Today, after 50,000+ miles of ownership and over 275,000 miles on the chassis, I've rebuilt, upgraded, and maintained nearly every system myself. This project launched my passion for mechanical engineering and problem-solving.</p>

    <h3>Lexus GX470 – Frame Repair & Restoration (Summer 2024 – Present)</h3>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Since last summer, I have been restoring a Lexus GX470’s rusted and damaged frame. Working when weather permits, I’ve removed extensive rust, fabricated and welded new metal sections, and repaired critical mounting points to restore structural integrity.</p>

    <h4>Major Work & Maintenance Performed:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Rust removal using a pneumatic needle scaler on accessible frame areas</li>
      <li>Cutting out severely corroded sections and fabricating new metal replacements</li>
      <li>Repair and precise realignment of broken rear trailing arm mount</li>
      <li>Application of phosphoric acid solution to convert remaining rust into a stable surface, followed by protective painting</li>
      <li>Replacement of corroded brake hard lines running from under the driver’s seat to rear calipers</li>
      <li>Replacement of rear sway bar links, including one rusted-off link</li>
      <li>Ongoing work on front subframe and surrounding areas involving needle scaling and repainting</li>
      <li>Planning to replace the timing belt once the vehicle is drivable</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Skills Gained:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Advanced rust removal and metal surface preparation techniques</li>
      <li>Custom metal fabrication and structural welding</li>
      <li>Precision alignment and restoration of suspension mounts</li>
      <li>Brake system maintenance and component replacement</li>
      <li>Project planning and working with weather-dependent schedules</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>BMW 740iL (E38) – Engine & Transmission Swap Project (2021–Present)</h3>
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Purchased in 2021 as a running vehicle with heavy smoke from the exhaust, this V8-powered luxury sedan became a full mechanical restoration project. I diagnosed and resolved several complex issues, including a mistimed replacement engine and a failed transmission install. This project pushed my skills in diagnostics, drivetrain work, and engine timing to a new level.</p>

  <h4>Major Work & Maintenance Performed:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial diagnostics and cooling system repair (coolant pipe replacement)</li>
    <li>PCV system service and oil system evaluation</li>
    <li>Engine removal and replacement with a used M62 engine</li>
    <li>Transmission replacement after improper torque converter installation</li>
    <li>BMW INPA diagnostics to isolate misfires to one bank</li>
    <li>Camshaft timing correction using timing kit and TDC alignment</li>
    <li>Restored engine performance with proper firing across all cylinders</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>Future work: address rough shifting by swapping valve body from original transmission, sourcing front bumper, and addressing catalytic converter restriction</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Skills Gained:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Advanced engine diagnostics and timing correction</li>
    <li>Hands-on experience with BMW factory diagnostic tools (INPA)</li>
