  <h1>Hi, I'm Lukasz Przeklasa</h1>
  <p>Mechanical Engineering graduate with a passion for hands-on problem-solving and deep experience in automotive systems, fabrication, and diagnostics.</p>

<section>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My engineering journey began long before college — fueled by a lifelong obsession with cars and a drive to learn by doing. My mom still recalls how the first toy I ever picked up was a little car, and that early fascination only grew. From collecting Hot Wheels and playing racing games to naming every car on the street, I was drawn to everything automotive.</p>

  <p>That passion became practical when I got my first car, a 1995 BMW 325i, which I’ve owned for over seven years and driven more than 60,000 miles. I’ve rebuilt and maintained nearly every system on that car, from the driveline, clutch, cooling system, and suspension, to brake and engine upgrades. I did it all myself, learning as I went. That hands-on experience didn’t just make me a capable technician — it inspired me to pursue a career in engineering, blending practical skill with design and analysis.</p>

  <p>Since then, I’ve worked on a range of personal and family vehicles, including off-road and luxury platforms like the Lexus GX470 and BMW 740iL. These projects have honed my ability to troubleshoot complex systems, fabricate custom solutions, and manage full vehicle repairs with precision and confidence.</p>

  <p>Today, I bring that same dedication, curiosity, and drive to every engineering challenge I take on. I'm always seeking opportunities where I can apply my hands-on background and technical knowledge to design better systems, solve real-world problems, and contribute to innovative mechanical solutions.</p>

<h3>Project 1: Thermal Isolation and Safety Design Study: Exhaust Mounting Solution (ANSYS FEA)</h3>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> To design and validate a safe, high-efficiency mounting solution for a 190&deg;C diesel heater exhaust pipe, focusing on minimizing heat conduction to the surrounding structure in a cold 0 &deg;C environment.</p>

<p>I utilized SolidWorks to model the plate, which served as a substitute for a jalousie window panel. This model was then simulated under conditions of an exhaust pipe running through it, based on the four materials I had readily available, to determine the best material for this application.</p>

<p><strong>Methodology: CAD & Steady-State Thermal FEA</strong></p> <p>The entire analysis followed a rigorous digital engineering workflow to ensure accuracy and inform the final design recommendation.</p>

<ol>
<li>CAD Modeling (SolidWorks): The plate geometry was precisely modeled in SolidWorks, including the critical central hole for the exhaust pipe.</li>
<li>Analysis Setup (ANSYS Discovery): The model was imported for a Steady-State Thermal FEA to evaluate heat conduction across materials.</li>
<li>Defining Boundary Conditions: The simulation mimicked a worst-case scenario:</li>
<ul>
<li>Heat Source (Input): A 190&deg;C Fixed Temperature was applied to the inner face of the exhaust hole, simulating the hot pipe surface.</li>
<li>Cooling Environment (Output): Convection was applied to all exterior surfaces <strong>h = 10&nbsp;W/(m&middot;K </strong>) at 0 &deg;C, representing cold ambient conditions.
  </li>
</ul>
<li>Material Comparison: Four simulations were run, one for each material (Carbon Steel, Stainless Steel, Aluminum, and Plywood), using their distinct Thermal Conductivity (<strong>k</strong>) values.</li>
<li>Key Metric: The Total Heat Flux (<strong>Q<sub>out</sub></strong>) was measured to quantify the total power (in Watts) escaping the plate, determining the most effective thermal isolation.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Results and Conclusion</h4> <p>The analysis compared materials with widely varying thermal conductivity, leading to a clear conclusion regarding performance and non-combustible safety requirements.</p>

<td>0.13&nbsp;W/(m&middot;K)</td>
<td>0.856 W</td>
<td><strong>Optimal Heat Isolation.</strong> Lowest heat loss, providing superior thermal isolation. <strong>Q<sub>out</sub></strong>.</td>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Final Engineering Recommendation:</strong></p><p>The analysis confirmed that Plywood delivered the superior thermal performance (<strong>Q<sub>out</sub></strong>) = 0.856 W for thermal isolation. While initially flagged due to the fire safety hazard posed by the 190&deg;C heat source, the final engineering decision is to select Plywood and mitigate the flammability risk by adding a non-combustible heat shield or ceramic collar between the exhaust pipe and the wood surface.</p>
<p>This approach prioritizes the optimal thermal performance of the wood, resulting in a 97.8% reduction in heat flow compared to the Carbon Steel baseline, and demonstrates the ability to solve a safety constraint through design iteration rather than performance compromise.</p>

<h3>Project 2: Structural Integrity and Rigidity Study: E36 Performance Clutch Fork (SolidWorks Simulation FEA)</h3>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> To design and validate a high-strength replacement eyelet for the BMW E36 clutch pedal assembly. This project addresses the notorious failure point of the factory plastic eyelet, which is prone to cracking and complete detachment when paired with high-pressure aftermarket performance clutches.</p>

<p>I utilized SolidWorks to model a custom-engineered metal eyelet as a robust, cost-effective alternative to expensive aftermarket conversion kits. By simulating the component under a "worst-case" 2500 N panic-load, I verified that this design provides a permanent fix to the "dead pedal" failure mode while improving shift precision through enhanced rigidity.</p>

<p><strong>Design Intent & Value Engineering</strong></p> <p>The OEM eyelet is made of brittle plastic, which often fails under the increased hydraulic resistance of performance clutch systems. While boutique billet conversion kits exist, they can be prohibitively expensive. This study demonstrates a "Value Engineering" approach: designing a precision-machined metal eyelet that delivers professional-grade reliability and a 9.31 Factor of Safety at a fraction of the market cost.</p>

<p><strong>Methodology: CAD & Static Structural FEA</strong></p> <p>The analysis followed a rigorous engineering workflow to ensure the part could handle the significant mechanical advantage generated by the clutch pedal lever arm.</p>

<ol> <li><strong>CAD Modeling (SolidWorks):</strong> The eyelet was modeled to match the critical dimensions of the E36 pedal pin and the Tilton-style master cylinder rod, replacing plastic with high-strength structural metal.</li> <li><strong>Analysis Setup (SolidWorks Simulation):</strong> 
  A Static Structural study was conducted to evaluate the eyelet’s response to high-leverage axial forces.</li> <li><strong>Defining Boundary Conditions:</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Load (Input):</strong> 
    A <strong>2500 N</strong> (~560 lbs) axial force was applied. This accounts for the 4:1 leverage ratio of the pedal and the high-clamp pressure of a Stage 2 hydraulic system during rapid engagement.</li>
     <li><strong>Fixtures (Constraints):</strong> The eyelet pin-hole was fixed to simulate the pivot point on the clutch pedal arm.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Sectional Analysis:</strong> Used Section Clipping to verify internal stress distribution, ensuring the transition between the threaded shaft and the eyelet body was structurally sound.</li> 
     <li><strong>Key Metrics:</strong> Von Mises Stress was checked against material yield, and Resultant Displacement was recorded to ensure a direct, non-compliant pedal feel.</li> </ol>

</figure>

<h4>Results and Conclusion</h4> <p>The simulation results prove that the custom eyelet delivers a massive improvement in safety and performance over the factory plastic component.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"> <thead> <tr> <th>Metric Tested</th> <th>Calculated Value</th> <th>Performance Summary</th> </tr> </thead>
   <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Peak Von Mises Stress</strong></td> <td>70.0 MPa</td> <td><strong>Fatigue Resistant.</strong> Metal construction eliminates the cracking common in OEM plastic units.</td> </tr>
     <tr> <td><strong>Max Displacement (Flex)</strong></td> <td>0.00169 mm</td> <td><strong>Direct Engagement.</strong> Removes the "spongy" feel caused by plastic deformation under load.</td> </tr> 
     <tr> <td><strong>Minimum Factor of Safety</strong></td> <td>9.31</td> <td><strong>Failsafe Design.</strong> Engineered to withstand over 9x the force required to shatter the factory clip.</td> </tr>
   </tbody>
 </table>

 <h4>Cost & Value Analysis</h4> <p>A primary driver for this study was <strong>Value Engineering</strong>. By identifying the specific failure point of the OEM system, a targeted solution was developed that offers high-performance results at a significant cost saving.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"> <thead> <tr> <th>Solution Type</th> <th>Cost</th> <th>Performance Factor</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Premium Aftermarket Billet Kit</strong></td> <td>~$200</td> <td>High (Over-engineered for branding)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Custom Engineered Metal Eyelet (Heim Joint and Old Hardware) (</strong></td> <td><strong>~$10.00</strong></td> <td><strong>Identical (Validated 9.31 FOS)</strong></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>

<p>This comparison highlights a <strong>90% reduction in cost</strong> while maintaining a safety margin that exceeds the requirements of a Stage 2 hydraulic clutch system.</p>

 <p><strong>Final Engineering Recommendation:</strong></p> 
 <p>Testing at a 2500 N load confirms that this reinforced eyelet is a permanent solution for E36 owners running performance clutches. By replacing the fatigue-prone plastic factory part with a specifically engineered metal alternative, the design achieved a 9.31 Factor of Safety and virtually zero flex (0.00169 mm). This modification ensures the driver will never be stranded by a shattered eyelet while providing the crisp, consistent bite-point required for high-performance driving.</p>

  <h3>Land Rover Range Rover Supercharged - Aesthetic Restoration</h3>
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Acquired a non-starting luxury SUV for a nominal cost of $500. Through systematic troubleshooting of the ignition and transmission interlock systems, I successfully bypassed a "no-start" condition that had previously grounded the vehicle. The project is currently focused on high-end aesthetic restoration and paint correction to maximize resale value.</p>

<p><strong>Technical Recovery & Value Engineering:</strong></p> 
<p>The vehicle was purchased as a non-runner after the previous owner was unable to diagnose a start-sequence failure. I identified a fault in the transmission gear position sensor/inhibitor switch. By shifting the vehicle into Neutral to complete the starting circuit, I restored functionality immediately, proving the engine and supercharged drivetrain were in excellent health without requiring mechanical overhaul.</p>

<p><strong>Major Work & Restoration Performed:</strong></p>
 <ul> <li><strong>Diagnostic Troubleshooting:</strong> Identified and bypassed faulty transmission inhibitor circuit to restore starting capabilities.</li>
   <li><strong>Drivetrain Validation:</strong> Conducted extensive road testing of the 4.2L Supercharged V8 to verify shift quality and engine cooling under load.</li> 
   <li><strong>Trim Restoration:</strong> Sourced and replaced degraded plastic exterior trim to restore the vehicle's premium "Black Label" aesthetic.</li> 
   <li><strong>Headlight Restoration:</strong> Multi-stage wet-sanding and UV-coating of oxidized headlight lenses to improve night visibility and modernise the front-end appearance.</li> 
   `<li><strong>Surface Preparation:</strong> Ongoing removal of failed clear-coat on the hood and roof panels; currently performing high-grit sanding and surface leveling in preparation for professional respray.</li> </ul>

<p><strong>Methodology: Paint Prep & Environmental Planning</strong></p> 
<p>Due to cold ambient temperatures, the project currently utilizes a <strong>Weather-Dependent Workflow</strong>. 
  High-labor prep tasks (sanding and masking) are performed during the winter months, ensuring that the substrate is perfectly leveled for the final base-coat and clear-coat application once temperatures rise to the required chemical-bonding range (20°C+).</p>

<h4>Projected Value Analysis</h4> 
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"> <thead> <tr> <th>Phase</th> <th>Cost Basis</th> 
  <th>Market Valuation</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Acquisition</strong></td> 
    <td>$500.00</td> <td>Non-Running / Salvage Value</td> </tr>
