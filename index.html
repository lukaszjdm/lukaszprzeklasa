  <h1>Hi, I'm Lukasz Przeklasa</h1>
  <p>Mechanical Engineering graduate with a passion for hands-on problem-solving and deep experience in automotive systems, fabrication, and diagnostics.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My engineering journey began long before college — fueled by a lifelong obsession with cars and a drive to learn by doing. My mom still recalls how the first toy I ever picked up was a little car, and that early fascination only grew. From collecting Hot Wheels and playing racing games to naming every car on the street, I was drawn to everything automotive.</p>

  <p>That passion became practical when I got my first car — a 1995 BMW 325i — which I’ve owned for over seven years and driven more than 60,000 miles. I’ve rebuilt and maintained nearly every system on that car, from the driveline, clutch, cooling system, and suspension, to brake and engine upgrades. I did it all myself, learning as I went. That hands-on experience didn’t just make me a capable technician — it inspired me to pursue a career in engineering, blending practical skill with design and analysis.</p>

  <p>Since then, I’ve worked on a range of personal and family vehicles, including off-road and luxury platforms like the Lexus GX470 and BMW 740iL. These projects have honed my ability to troubleshoot complex systems, fabricate custom solutions, and manage full vehicle repairs with precision and confidence.</p>

  <p>Today, I bring that same dedication, curiosity, and drive to every engineering challenge I take on. I'm always seeking opportunities where I can apply my hands-on background and technical knowledge to design better systems, solve real-world problems, and contribute to innovative mechanical solutions.</p>

    <h3>BMW 325i (E36) – Ongoing Personal Project (2018–Present)</h3>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> My first car and my most important teacher — I bought this 1995 BMW 325i seven years ago with no mechanical experience. Today, after 50,000+ miles of ownership and over 275,000 miles on the chassis, I've rebuilt, upgraded, and maintained nearly every system myself. This project launched my passion for mechanical engineering and problem-solving.</p>
