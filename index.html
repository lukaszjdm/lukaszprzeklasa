  <h1>Hi, I'm Lukasz Przeklasa</h1>
  <p>Mechanical Engineering graduate with a passion for hands-on problem-solving and deep experience in automotive systems, fabrication, and diagnostics.</p>

<section>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My engineering journey began long before college — fueled by a lifelong obsession with cars and a drive to learn by doing. My mom still recalls how the first toy I ever picked up was a little car, and that early fascination only grew. From collecting Hot Wheels and playing racing games to naming every car on the street, I was drawn to everything automotive.</p>

  <p>That passion became practical when I got my first car, a 1995 BMW 325i, which I’ve owned for over seven years and driven more than 60,000 miles. I’ve rebuilt and maintained nearly every system on that car, from the driveline, clutch, cooling system, and suspension, to brake and engine upgrades. I did it all myself, learning as I went. That hands-on experience didn’t just make me a capable technician — it inspired me to pursue a career in engineering, blending practical skill with design and analysis.</p>

  <p>Since then, I’ve worked on a range of personal and family vehicles, including off-road and luxury platforms like the Lexus GX470 and BMW 740iL. These projects have honed my ability to troubleshoot complex systems, fabricate custom solutions, and manage full vehicle repairs with precision and confidence.</p>

  <p>Today, I bring that same dedication, curiosity, and drive to every engineering challenge I take on. I'm always seeking opportunities where I can apply my hands-on background and technical knowledge to design better systems, solve real-world problems, and contribute to innovative mechanical solutions.</p>

<h3>Project 1: Thermal Isolation and Safety Design Study: Exhaust Mounting Solution (ANSYS FEA)</h3>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> To design and validate a safe, high-efficiency mounting solution for a 190&deg;C diesel heater exhaust pipe, focusing on minimizing heat conduction to the surrounding structure in a cold 0 &deg;C environment.</p>

<p>I utilized SolidWorks to model the plate, which served as a substitute for a jalousie window panel. This model was then simulated under conditions of an exhaust pipe running through it, based on the four materials I had readily available, to determine the best material for this application.</p>

<p><strong>Methodology: CAD & Steady-State Thermal FEA</strong></p> <p>The entire analysis followed a rigorous digital engineering workflow to ensure accuracy and inform the final design recommendation.</p>

<ol>
<li>CAD Modeling (SolidWorks): The plate geometry was precisely modeled in SolidWorks, including the critical central hole for the exhaust pipe.</li>
<li>Analysis Setup (ANSYS Discovery): The model was imported for a Steady-State Thermal FEA to evaluate heat conduction across materials.</li>
<li>Defining Boundary Conditions: The simulation mimicked a worst-case scenario:</li>
<ul>
<li>Heat Source (Input): A 190&deg;C Fixed Temperature was applied to the inner face of the exhaust hole, simulating the hot pipe surface.</li>
<li>Cooling Environment (Output): Convection was applied to all exterior surfaces <strong>h = 10&nbsp;W/(m&middot;K </strong>) at 0 &deg;C, representing cold ambient conditions.
  </li>
</ul>
<li>Material Comparison: Four simulations were run, one for each material (Carbon Steel, Stainless Steel, Aluminum, and Plywood), using their distinct Thermal Conductivity (<strong>k</strong>) values.</li>
<li>Key Metric: The Total Heat Flux (<strong>Q<sub>out</sub></strong>) was measured to quantify the total power (in Watts) escaping the plate, determining the most effective thermal isolation.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Results and Conclusion</h4> <p>The analysis compared materials with widely varying thermal conductivity, leading to a clear conclusion regarding performance and non-combustible safety requirements.</p>

<td>0.13&nbsp;W/(m&middot;K)</td>
<td>0.856 W</td>
<td><strong>Optimal Heat Isolation.</strong> Lowest heat loss, providing superior thermal isolation. <strong>Q<sub>out</sub></strong>.</td>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Final Engineering Recommendation:</strong></p><p>The analysis confirmed that Plywood delivered the superior thermal performance (<strong>Q<sub>out</sub></strong>) = 0.856 W for thermal isolation. While initially flagged due to the fire safety hazard posed by the 190&deg;C heat source, the final engineering decision is to select Plywood and mitigate the flammability risk by adding a non-combustible heat shield or ceramic collar between the exhaust pipe and the wood surface.</p>
<p>This approach prioritizes the optimal thermal performance of the wood, resulting in a 97.8% reduction in heat flow compared to the Carbon Steel baseline, and demonstrates the ability to solve a safety constraint through design iteration rather than performance compromise.</p>
